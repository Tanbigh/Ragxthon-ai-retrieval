# RAGxthon AI Retrieval Project

This project is built for **RAGxthon 2026**, a hackathon focused on building intelligent systems using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

The system combines **embedding models, vector databases, and retrieval techniques** to provide context-aware answers to user queries.

---

# Project Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves the performance of language models by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge source before generating a response.

This project implements a simple **RAG pipeline** using a dataset, embeddings, a vector database, and a retrieval mechanism to answer user questions.

---

# System Architecture

The architecture of the RAG system follows this flow:

Data Source → Embeddings → Vector Database → Retrieval → LLM → Generated Response

# RAG Pipeline

The system works in the following steps:

1. **Load Dataset**
   The system loads the dataset containing knowledge used for answering queries.

2. **Generate Embeddings**
   Text data is converted into vector embeddings using a **SentenceTransformer model**.

3. **Store in Vector Database**
   The embeddings are stored in a **FAISS vector database** for efficient similarity search.

4. **Retrieve Relevant Context**
   When a user asks a question, the retriever searches the vector database to find the most relevant documents.

5. **Generate Response**
   The retrieved context is used by the pipeline to generate the final answer.
